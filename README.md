# Optimal-Hours-Prediction
I have tried optimal hours predicition for booking of flight by training the dataset using random forest regressor.
Model deployment has been done using Flask and front end is created using html, css.
To run the program just write cmd on the folder and then type python app.py
enter the values in numerical form and then it would give you correct prediction.
To add some new data intents to the exisiting model I amtrying to use a particualr api which could give me the data and then I could train my model every 6 months.
so there is no need to train the model again after adding new data, and then creating the pickle file again.
